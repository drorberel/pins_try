First, update our model:

```{r}
# fit a simple model that will change with each run
ids <- sample(1:nrow(mtcars), size = 30, replace = TRUE)
dataset <- mtcars[ids,]
m <- lm(mpg ~ hp + cyl + disp, data = dataset)
print(m)
```

Next, pin the model to Connect:

```{r}
library(pins)
# Tell the pins package about your Connect server
board_register("rsconnect", 
               server = "https://colorado.rstudio.com/rsc",
               # use an API key if the RMD will run on Connect
               key = Sys.getenv("RSC_KEY")) 
# push the model to Connect
pin(m, name = "mtcar-model", board = "rsconnect")
```
